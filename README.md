# WTO-Global-Trade-dashboard
I created a dashboard in Power Bi desktop that summarises by country WTO data about goods import and export.
The first page contain global stats, it is possible to select a specific country and to drill through to a second page for country specific stats. 

The data was extracted from WTO website : https://stats.wto.org/
